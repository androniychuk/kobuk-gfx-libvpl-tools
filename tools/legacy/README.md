This directory contains sample tools inherited from IntelÂ® Media SDK.

Please note: these tools are provided so that end users can explore capabilities.  They are not intended for direct use in customer products.

# sample_multi_transcode (SMT)

This is the main functionality showcase, demonstrating a wide variety of features and pipelines.

# sample_encode, sample_decode, sample_vpp

These smaller examples are intended to be easier to use than SMT since they focus on individual stages.
Most of the options overlap SMT, though occasionally features are only added to these single stage tools.

# metrics monitor

The metrics monitor is made available for legacy purposes but no longer maintained.  It shows how media hardware utilization can be
queried from the Linux OS in real time.  In the future other options to do this will be highlighted and metrics monitor will be
removed.
